Hello there! 

My name is **Wildan** and I am a master of communication at [Telkom University](https://mcomms.telkomuniversity.ac.id/). 
My research interests are in human resources, health communication, and social network analysis.

In my free time, I usually play sports (badminton and running) and do my hobbies (journaling and linux-ing). The linux distro that I use as my daily driver is [**Kali Linux**](https://www.kali.org/).

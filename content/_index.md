Hola! 

My full name is Abdullah Wildan Ulhaq, but you can simply call me Wildan! I am a <mark>**Linux Ricer**</mark>, <mark>**Cyber Security Enthusiast**</mark>, <mark>**Data Analyst**</mark>, <mark>**Artificial Intelligence (AI) Admirer**</mark>, and a <mark>**Chess Player**</mark>. This blog is the place I use basically to share my hobbies, experiences, thoughts, and other activities I'd like to share with. If you don't mind, you can give some greetings or anything in the comment section (it is under constructio, btw ðŸ˜Š) at the bottom of each article in this site.

So, nice to meet you, and...    
Happy reading! ðŸ˜ƒ

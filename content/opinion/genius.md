A wise word once said, "***Many things can be acquired with money, many by deceit, and many by falsehood. But, there is one thing that can be obtained only by honest labor, for which a king must work as hard as a coalman..., and that is knowledge.***".

A lot of people judging other as a genius or a stupid one. They did that kind of judging usually when they were arguing each other about something (politics is one of them). But, when it comes to definition, I am a hundred percent sure that they can't define what genius is with a single perfect statement. So, before we go deeper into the subject, which is "How to be A Genius in Everything", let's talk a bit about what genius is first.

But, for you guys that might be wondering, *does it urge to talk about genius-ness like this*? I promise, I'll tell you the urgency later in the end of the article.

Oke, I would like to start the discussion with making some assumptions about what genius is.

First, I'll assume that genius is a person that have an intelligent capability to literally reign almost everything fast and easy.

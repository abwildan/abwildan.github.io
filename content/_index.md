Hola! 

My full name is Abdullah Wildan Ulhaq, but just call me Wildan! I am a **`Linux Ricer`**, **`Cyber Security Enthusiast`**, **`Data Analyst`**, **`Artificial Intelligence (AI) Admirer`**, and a **`Chess Player`**. This blog is the place I use basically to share my hobby, experience, thoughts, and other activities I'd like to share. If you don't mind, you can give some greetings or anything in the comment section at the bottom of each article in this site.

So, nice to meet you, and...    
Happy reading! ðŸ˜ƒ
